A. Change the root password to “changeme”( This is the precondition you must meet it )
Answer
1. Poweron the system and on grub menu when countdown start press e and enter
2. Go to the end of the line below and press space just after 8 and type rd.break and press ctrl+x

Linux16 /vmlinuz -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------quiet LANG=enUS.UTF-8(space)rd.break(press ctrl+x)
3. #mount -o remount,rw /sysroot
4.#chroot /sysroot
5.#passwd root
 type new password for root: changeme
 retype new password for root:changeme
6.#touch /.autorelabel
7.Exit
8.Exit
You see logout and after reboot login in as root using password(changeme1) 


1. Setup Network and hostname as given below 
IP: 192.168.0.10 
Netmask: 255.255.255.0
Gateway: 192.168.0.1
DNS:192.168.0.254
Hostname:client12.example.com

Answer
1. #cd /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts
2. ls -l ifcfg-*  ( you will see all the file starting form ifcfg- now choose ifcfg-ens33)
3. Vi  ifcfg-ens33  and add the following entry just below the lastline of the file
      IPADDR=192.168.0.10
 SUBNETMASK=255.255.255.0
GATEWAY=192.168.0.1
     DNS=192.168.0.254

And save and exit(press Esc type :wq enter)

Changing hostname
#hostnamectl set-hostname client12.example.com
# vi /etc/hosts
Press i
   192.168.0.11 client12.example.com	ravi (nickname)
Save and exit (press Esc :wq enter) save and exit

Now 
Check your current target and change it to graphical.target if it is not so.
For that 
# systemctl get-default
( if result of the command is garphical.target you don’t do anything 
If it is multiuser-target then run the command to change it to graphical.target using the command below
#systemctl set-default garphical.target
Verify it 
#systemctl get-default
graphical.target will be your result ( then you are good).


Now mask iptables ip6tables and firewalld.service
#systemctl mask iptables.service
#systemctl mask ip6tables.service
#systemctl mask firewalld.service


Reboot your system
#reboot
verify you ip address 
# ip a
192.168.0.10( This is the example, you might have different ip address)
After this you are ready to solve your exam questions

2 Setup YUM repo as per given yum location http://server.example.com/rhel7

Answer

#mkdir defaultrepo  mv all existing repofile to defaultrepo dir (using mv command)

# cd /etc/yum.repos.d
vi my.repo                ( make sure your repo file must end on.repo ) and press I
[agrima]
name=examrepo
baseurl=http://server.example.com/rhel7
gpgcheck=0
enabled=1
Save and exit (press Esc :wq)
#yum clean all
#yum repolist
Make sure your just created repo examrepo exists



(user creation)



3. Create the following users,groups and supplementary groups.

   i)  Create a group manager.

   ii) Add user natasha and rocky with a secondary group to the manager group.

   iii)Create a user harry with no login shell and who is not a member of manager.

   iv) Set a password for all users as redhat.

Answer
i. #groupadd manager

ii #useradd natasha
 #useradd rocky
 #usermod -aG manager natasha
 #usermod -aG manager rocky
Iii useradd -s /sbin/nologin harry
Iv# passwd natasha
Type new password for user natasha: password
Retype new password for user natasha:password



#password rocky

Type new password for user rocky: password
Retype new password for user rocky:password
#password harry
Type new password for user harry: password
Retype new password for user harry:password

Now verify using id command
#id natasha
#Id rocky
#Id harry

# su - harry
Password for harry: password
User cannot login now

                    (permission)
4.Create a directory /opt/myshare with following conditions.

   i) change group ownership to managers

   ii)read and write to the members to the managers group but not to others except root.

   iii) Files created under /opt/myshare will have automatically group ownership set to managers.

Answer
# ls -ld /opt/myshare
If directory /opt/myshare exists it shows the information here if not no such file or directory message pop up.
Let’s say you did not have /opt/myshare directory then simply make it 
#mkdir /opt/myshare
i #chmod :managers /opt/myshare
Or 
#chgrp managers /opt/myshare
ii chmod 770 /opt/myshare
Ii #chmod g+s /opt/myshare

5. Copy the file /etc/fstab to /var/tmp.The file should owned by natasha and change the group ownership as managers,  the rocky could read,write and modify it while agrima wouldnot do that.
#cp /etc/fstab /var/tmp
#chown natasha:managers /var/tmp/fstab
Or
#chown natasha /var/tmp/fstab
#chgrp managers /var/tmp/fstab
#setfacl -m u:rocky:rw-  /var/tmp/fstab
#setfacl -m u:agrima:--- /var/tmp/fstab
Verify it using command
#getfacl /var/tmp/fstab


                       (Job scheduling)
6.  Schedule a cronjob by user natasha who runs the command /bin/echo "hiya" at 14:23 everyday.

Verify that package cronie is installed or not
#rpm -q cronie
If given packages information then package is installed on that case enable and restart crond if not 
 run the following command
# yum install cronie
#systemctl enable crond
#systemctl start crond
#crontab -eu natasha      ( and add the follwoing entry on it)
23 14 * * * /bin/echo hiya  

Save and exit
Verify the job that you just scheduled for user natasha
#crontab -lu natasha

7.Create a cron job that reboots your computer at 2:15 p.m every day  as root.
Login as user 
#crontab -eu root
15 14 * * * systemctl reboot
And save and exit
#crontab -lu root








8. Configuration your machine as LDAP client. LDAP server and LDAP directory tree 
information given below.
a ldapuser10 should be able to log into your system, where X is your station number,but will not have completed the autofs requirement.
b All ldapuser users have password of "password"
c.configure LDAP Search Base DN 
with:dc=example,dc=com
d. configure LDAP server with the URL: ldap://server1.example.com
e. Download CA from Certificate URL:
http://server1.example.com/example-ca.crt
f. configure AUTOFS for the LDAP user so that the home directory of LDAP USER should be mounted automatically on the Machine.Share location Visa NFS from the 
server server1.example.com:/home/guests/ldapuserX

Answer
# yum install  -y openldap-clients nss-pam-ldapd sssd authconfig-gtk
# authconfig-gtk
 

 
And click apply
# systemctl enable sssd
#systemctl start sssd
# getent password ldapuser10
And user the password for ldapuser10 which is password and we should able to login as ldapuser10 in our system but we will not be able to find ldapuser10’s home directory for that we have to install autofs for that please see the command below
#yum install  -y rpcbind nfs-utils autofs
# systemctl enable autofs
#systemctl start autofs
Verify mannual mount for share mounting on /mnt dir
#mount.nfs server1.example.com:/home/guests /mnt
Or 

#df -h
( nfs share mount point should mount under /mnt dir)
# umount /mnt
# vi /etc/auto.master    ( add the entry below after last line)
/home/guests   /etc/auto.ldap
 And save and exit
# vi /etc/auto.ldap   ( add the entry for nfs share for ldapuser10)
Ldapuser10 -rw server1.example.com:/home/guests/ldapuser10
# su - ldapuser10 
Password ldapuser10  so that we should be able to find the ldapusers home directory
Pwd
/home/guests/ldapuser10


9.. Configure NTP with server1.example.com

# rpm -q chronyd ( verifying if package is installed already if not install)
# yum install chrony*
# systemctl enable chronyd
#systemctl start chronyd
# vi /etc/chrony.conf
Disable all default ntp servers in the file and add a line below
Server server1.example.com iburst
And save and exit
# chronyc sources -v 
If the statrum are 0,1,2,3 we are fine


 10. Implement a web server for the site http://yourhost.expanor.local , then perform the following 
- Download http://sama.expanor.local/devi/station.html
- Rename the downloaded file to index.html.
#yum install httpd*
#systemctl enable httpd
#systemctl start httpd
#systemctl status httpd
Go to the firefox browser and type the given link above in the question
 http://yourhost.expanor.local 
Write clieck on the link and 
Select save link as 
Click on filesystem
Click on var
Click on tmp
And save
#mv /var/tmp/station.html /var/www/html/index.html
Open the firefox browser and  and type the link as
http://agrima.expanor.local/var/www/html/index.html
So that it the content of file index.html should be popped up there

11.Download upgraded kernel package from 
ftp://rhcert.server10.example.com/bub/x86_64/rhcsa. The upgraded kernel should be the
default kernel of your system and the original kernel should also be there.
Answer
Open the browser (firefox)
Use the given url  ftp://rhcert.server10.example.com/bub/x86_64/rhcsa
You will see the lists of file there 
Just download all file clicking each of them turn by turn 
Clicking on right click 
Save link as 
File system
Var
Tmp
And save
Repeat the above process for all the files to save on /var/tmp
Now save your existing kernel on /var/tmp
#uname -rms |tee -a /var/tmp/old.kernel   ( so that existing kernel will be saved on /var/tmp/old.kernel and prints on the screen as you will have used tee command)
Now run the command to update the kernel
#rpm -ivh kernel*

12.Locate all uncommented lines in file /etc/ssh/sshd_config and copy the lines
in a same order on /root/list file.
#grep ‘^[#;] /etc/ssh/sshd /var/tmp/ssh.txt

13.Find the string strator from /usr/share/dict/words and copy it to /root/int.txt files 
     so that original contents remain intact and make sure there

    is no gap between the lines.

  # grep strator /usr/share/dict/words |tr '\n' ' ' > /root/int.txt


14. Locate files owned by simon and copy it to /root/found directory.
#ls -ld /root/found
# mkdir /root/found
# find / -user simon -exec cp -ap {} /root/found/ \;



15.Make a new lvm in a new volume group. Name your volume group as myvol and lvm as mylvm. The size of lvm should be of 64 extents and base size should be 16MB. Permanently mount the logical volume on /datadir directory as ext4 filesystem.


Here base 16M time physical extents 64 = 1024M so lets make 1200M size of disk
#fdisk /dev/vda
n enter 
p enter
Enter
Enter 
+1200M
t 
8e 
w 
#partprobe -s /dev/sdb
#pvcreate /dev/sdb1
#vgcreate -s 16M myvol /dev/sdb1
# lvcreate -l 64M -n mylvm myvol
#mkfs.ext4 /dev/myvol/mylvm
#blkid /dev/myvol/mylvm
UUID=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
#vi /etc/fstab
Go to the end of the file and enter a new line as

UUID=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx ext4 /datadir defaualts 0 0
And save and exit
#mkdir /datadir
#mount /dev/myvol/mylvm /datadir
# df -h 
So file system should be here mounted on /datadir





16.. Extend the filesystem /data to 500M.

Answer
Create one partition of 250M as explained in  because there is alread 250M file system mounted on 
/data  change the partition to  8e for LVM and perform below commands. /data
Is already 250M so we have to increase only by 250M to make it 500M.
Here volume group name is datavg
Logical volume name is datalv
#pvcreate /dve/sda6
#vgextend /datavg /dev/sda6
#lvextend -L +250M /dev/datavg/datalv  /datavg
#resize2fs /dev/datavg/datalv
#df -h /data



17.. Extend the swap space with "500" MB , don't remove the 
existing swap. It should be available even after reboot.
#fdisk /dev/sda
Type p and enter type n and enter (Create new partition: press e to create extended partition , press p to create the main partition , and the extended partition is further divided in to logical partitions) enter
+500M enter
 Type t enter  Whose hex code is 82 for swap
Type w and enter
#parteprobe /dev/sda ( if did not show up reboot)
#mkswap /dev/sda7
#swapon /dev/sda7
#swapon -a
#blkid /dev/sda7 (copy UUID)
#vi /etc/fstab
UUID=xxxxxxxxx	swap	swap	defaults	0 0
#swapon -s (to verify)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------






18. Resize a filesystem of vgshare-lvshare to 100MIB so that the orignal data remains intact. During this process the size 95 to 105M is acceptable.
check the mount point in /etc/fstab
# vi /etc/fstab   ( that lvm vgshare-lvshare was mounted on /lvmpoint)
unmount file system
# umount /lvmpoint

# e2fsck -f /dev/vgshare/lvshare
# resize2fs /dev/vgshare/lvshare 105M
# lvreduce -L 105 /dev/mapper/vgshare/lvshare

   
19. Create a gzipped tar archive file /root/varlog.tgz containing all the files in /var/log

Create a gzipped tar archive file /root/varlog.tgz containing all the files in /var/log

# tar -cvzf /root/varlog.tgz /var/log

20  Locate all the files with name "date" and save the output to /tmp/locate.txt

# locate date >> /tmp/locate.txt
